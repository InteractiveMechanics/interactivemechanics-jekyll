                <p>Interactive Mechanics has two priorities: our team and our clients. <a href="/about-us">Our team</a> is actively involved in the growth and betterment of the company through regular start-stop-continue meetings, an annual planning and retreat meeting, and monthly one-on-ones with the owner. Our employee benefits include:</p>
                <p><strong>Unlimited Paid Time Off</strong><br>
                    We believe in a healthy work-life balance, so we suggest that employees take a <em>minimum of two weeks off</em> to relax and recharge. In addition to seven paid holidays, we also take off the entire week between Christmas and New Years and <em>flexible work hours</em>.</p>
                <p><strong>Matched Retirement Account</strong><br>
                    We provide a Simple IRA retirement plan and match 100% of your contributions, up to 3% of your annual salary.</p>
                <p><strong>Educational Stipend</strong><br>
                    You earn $50 for every 40 hours you work towards professional development, from conferences and workshops to books and online training. We also reimburse for museum outings to keep on top of industry trends.</p>
                <p><strong>Regular Lunches, Team Talks, and Outings</strong><br>
                    We pay for monthly team lunches, team talks (share your knowledge with the team), an annual holiday party, and company outings to bowl, rollerskate, or explore local museums.</p>
                <p><strong>Collaborative work environment</strong><br>
                    Our team is currently based out of CultureWorks, an amazing co-working studio in downtown Philadelphia. You'll have your own desk with our team, including dedicated storage and a new laptop, monitor, and other technology that fits your role.</p>

                <h5 class="gold-text">Our hiring process</h5>
                <p><strong>After you apply</strong>, our team conducts a blind review of your resume and application materials to eliminate unconscious bias (we'll strip out your name and any other indication of gender, race, ethnicity, or disability). This helps us attempt to review every candidate fairly. We'll review your materials against the skills and requirements listed in the job posting, so your application should speak to those points.
                <p>A selection of candidates will be invited to <strong>interview on-site with our team</strong> and provide references. We'll send you a detailed email with everything you need to know for the day of the interview, but you should be prepared to talk about your past work and talk through problems or process related to your role. You'll meet with the owner and up to two other members of our team&mdash;interviews typically take three hours. We're a pretty casual company, so appropriate interview attire is business casual.</p>
                <h5 class="gold-text">Equal Opportunity</h5>
                <p>We believe that we deliver higher value to our clients by bringing a diverse viewpoint to every project. Interactive Mechanics aims to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to promoting equal treatment regardless of religious belief, age, color, race, creed, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, political affiliation, ethnic origin, family status, or disability. This commitment applies to all areas of our work environment, including recruitment, selecting, training, compensation, promotion, and layoff.</p>
