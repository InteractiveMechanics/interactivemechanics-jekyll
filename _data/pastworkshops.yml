    body:       "At its core, User Experience (UX) is how your audience feels about using a product, system, or service, whether you're designing a website, an exhibit, or a toaster. How can you make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do you know if your target audience is having a good or bad experience? We'll cover the fundamentals of UX, why it matters, and ways to convince others in your organization to invest in this process. We'll detail a typical UX journey and common methodologies, from user research and analysis to rapid prototyping and testing, including lean UX techniques you can use with limited time and money."

    body:       "Prototypes are early interactive models you can build to test an idea before any code is written. They can range from sketches on paper to a series of click-through screens, and they allow you to learn directly from your visitors before spending time and money on software development. In this session, we'll cover options for rapidly developing prototypes, including paper prototyping and creating rich interactive experiences using free online tools. We'll review how to use these prototypes to conduct lean user tests (in-person and remotely) on a limited budget and schedule."
