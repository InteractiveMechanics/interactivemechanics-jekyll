    Where do you start if you want to build a new website, mobile app, or exhibit interactive? Drafting a product definition document can help you clarify and communicate key information about your project in order to get stakeholders on board, apply for funding, or request proposals from vendors.

    In this workshop, we'll translate your project concept and early research into a product definition document, including project goals, audience information, and user stories that outline major features and functionality. We'll also provide you with a template to use for compiling future product definition documents.
    
    This workshop is for anyone in the early stages of planning a digital project for arts and culture, and all you'll need is a project concept and a description of your project audience.
