summary: |
    Surface Design Association promotes awareness and appreciation of textile inspired art and design, and they needed a new website to better suit the aesthetic of their members' work. We created a modern, streamlined website that makes resources easy to find and reflects the organization's craft and creativity.

        We worked closely with the Surface Design team to revamp the site structure to better serve their main objectives. We started by refining the sitemap, creating clear and useful pathways to the information most important to members and SDA leadership. Several rounds of wireframes and visual design treatments ensured the site met stakeholders' expectations and properly communicated the SDA message. We revised early design concepts to produce a clean and contemporary look and feel that allows the artwork to speak for itself and to appeal to a wider audience.

        We built surfacedesign.org in Wordpress using various plugins and integrations to provide more robust user and admin experiences. We used [Events Calendar Pro](https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/) to build a searchable calendar, allowing members to find events near them. We also included a custom social media feed on the home page, displaying both Twitter and Instagram posts, in a way that encourages user engagement and adheres to the visual design concept.

        We also used SDA's customer relationship management system, NeonCRM, in a variety of ways. The custom member directory pulls all current members directly from NeonCRM and allows search and filtering by location, artist medium, and name. We also integrated NeonCRM's [sign-in plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/neoncrm-sign-in/) paired with an advanced system of permissions and roles, allowing members to manage their own online galleries as well as their membership from a single login.

outcome:

    body: |
        Through restructuring and redesigning the site, we were able to consolidate SDA's web presence into a single WordPress installation. The previous site was built in Drupal with a Wordpress blog, and the two sections of the site were designed differently, causing confusion for users. Switching between the two content management systems was also cumbersome for SDA site administrators. In the redesign, we built the blog into the site and imported all the existing blog content. The result is a much cleaner, more elegant website that better communicates the benefits and features of the organization, showcases and appreciates member artwork, and is easily maintained by SDA staff.
