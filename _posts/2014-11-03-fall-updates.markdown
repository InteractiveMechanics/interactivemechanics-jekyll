    Happy Fall! The leaves are falling in Philadelphia, holiday decorations are appearing in stores, and the pumpkin spice latte is going strong. Fall is in full swing, and so is our team as we continue working with great organizations on amazing projects.

### Grand Round Table website and interface
Grand Round Table builds innovative ways to improve decision-making for health care providers through technology. We worked with them to design an easy-to-use interface and a new website that better communicates their mission to improve our health care system with data-driven insights. To learn more, read the full case study or [see how we built the new site with Jekyll](http://interactivemechanics.com/news/2014/10/jekyll-vs-the-cms/).


### New projects with The Mayor's Fund, Ford's Theatre
We're kicking off projects for [Ford's Theatre](http://www.fords.org/) in Washington D.C. and [The Mayor's Fund for Philadelphia](http://www.mayorsfundphila.org/) in our home city. Interactive Mechanics will work with Ford's Theatre to build *Remembering Lincoln*, an online collection of responses to Abraham Lincoln's assassination that is designed to commemorate 150 years since Lincoln's death. We'll collaborate with The Mayor's Fund to redesign their website to feature their initiatives and partners. Keep an eye on our blog for more updates over the next few months.

### Workshops, training, and open office hours
Interactive Mechanics is now offering workshops for product teams, nonprofits, and educational and historical institutions. We'll help you audit and validate product ideas, conduct user analysis, collaborate through sketching and prototyping, and produce more compelling requests for grant funding. In addition, we're now offering public office hours at the Corzo Center for the Creative Economy, and closed office hours for DreamIt Ventures participants!
