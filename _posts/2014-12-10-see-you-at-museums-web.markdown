summary: |
    We’re proud to announce that we’ll be presenting at half-day pre-conference workshop at next year’s [Museums and the Web](http://mw2015.museumsandtheweb.com/) conference, hosted in the wonderful “Windy City.”

---

Our workshop will serve as a crash course on Omeka, giving new users the basic skills they need to get an Omeka site up-and-running quickly. We’ll also explain some of the advance features of the platform, like using the built-in API for developing your own, custom projects.

What to expect from our workshop:

* Learn what Omeka is, why it can be useful, and how it differs from systems like Drupal and WordPress.
* Explore the basics of building an Omeka site, including how to install and use plugins or themes.
* Review how to modify or work with Omeka’s theme structure to customize your site.
* See how to use the Omeka API to export or interact with your data, or build a custom system using it.
