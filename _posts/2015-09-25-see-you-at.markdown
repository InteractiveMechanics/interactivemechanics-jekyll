There’s a lot going on this fall, and I’m super excited to kick things off this weekend with MuseumNext’s first US conference. MuseumNext is focused on the future of museums, so you can expect top-notch technology talks, and this year’s theme is Building Inclusive Museums, so basically, everything I love in one place. Also it is IN TWO MUSEUMS. Check out my program highlights below. I’ll be hanging around till Monday afternoon if you’re in Indianapolis and want to chat - find me on twitter [@ameliaexmachina](https://twitter.com/ameliaexmachina)!

### MuseumNext: Amelia’s Picks

##### [Leading Inclusion](http://www.museumnext.com/conference/session/leading-inclusion/)
**Seema Rao**, Director, Intergenerational Learning, Cleveland Museum of Art<br/>
*A call to arms empowering all of us to use technology as a tool of inclusion in the museums of the future.*
I’ve definitely seen tech both help and hinder inclusivity, and I’m excited to get some tips and insights from Seema, whose background is a killer trifecta of Art History, User Experience Design, and Library Sciences.


##### [The Born-Digital Art Institution](http://www.museumnext.com/conference/session/the-born-digital-art-institution/)
**Zachary Kaplan**, Assistant Director, Rhizome<br/>
*New models for what an art institution can be when it organizes itself with the internet at its core.*
Zachary will talk about Rhizome and other internet-based art institutions. I’m super curious about similarities and differences in audiences (and audience building strategies) between internet-based and traditional museums.


##### [Mining the Digital Landscape, Engaging Communities of Color](http://www.museumnext.com/conference/session/digitallandscape/)
**Adrianne Russell**, Museum educator, literary artist and nonprofit consultant<br/>
**Ravon Ruffin**, Co-Creator, Brown Girls Museum Blog<br/>
*Exploring digital havens for marginalized black and brown communities and ways museums can engage them.*
I love that Adrianne and Ravon will be discussing both what’s already existing (and often ignored) in marginalized communities, as well as ways for museums to truly engage them. I have a hunch there will be some applications for user experience as well.
