Join our team during [Philly Tech Week 2015](http://2015.phillytechweek.com/) for a lunch and learn—food and drinks included—to increase your understanding of digital projects in the arts and culture sector. In this lunchtime digital primer, you’ll learn how to define key elements of your project, conduct relevant research, draft a request for proposals, select a vendor, and maintain your project once it’s built. We’ll also discuss common project types and key terminology, so you can feel confident talking to partners, funders, external stakeholders, and your team.
