The [National Museum of the American Indian](http://nmai.si.edu/) has launched a national education initiative, [Native Knowledge 360 Degrees](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360) (NK360°), which provides online materials, professional development and training, as well as advocacy and national partnerships to improve teaching and learning about American Indians.
We had the pleasure of creating four of the interactive learning resources that are included in the newest educational resources from NK360°:  

* Northern Plains History and Cultures Inquiry: How Do Native People and Nations Experience Belonging? [nmai.si.edu/nk360/plains-belonging](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360/plains-belonging)
* Northern Plains Treaties Inquiry: Is a Treaty Intended to Be Forever? [nmai.si.edu/nk360/plains-treaties](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360/plains-treaties)
* Pacific Northwest History and Cultures Inquiry: Why Do the Foods We Eat Matter? [nmai.si.edu/nk360/pnw-history-cultures](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360/pnw-history-cultures)
* Pacific Northwest Fish Wars Inquiry: What Kinds of Actions Can Lead to Justice? [nmai.si.edu/nk360/pnw-fish-wars](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360/pnw-fish-wars)

**Featured in the Pacific Northwest History and Cultures Inquiry: Salmon Challenges Game**
[Play and learn](http://nmai.si.edu/nk360/pnw-history-culture/pnw1-salmon/index.html) what it’s like to be a salmon. Navigate the many kinds of challenges that salmon face in their long journey upstream. This activity is part of a section that teaches how Native Nations of the Pacific Northwest protect and sustain salmon, water, and their homelands.

We also created annotator functions which can be seen on each of the four inquiry lessons. Users can manipulate the annotator tool in order to write notes, get definitions, hear pronunciations, and more.
