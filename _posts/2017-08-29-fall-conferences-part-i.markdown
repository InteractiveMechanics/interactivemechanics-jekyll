### Mike is Looking Forward to...

My favorite part about traveling for conferences is visiting the local museums. I have a long list of museums to attend while in Pittsburg and Austin: the Carnegie Museums, Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Andy Warhol Museum, Austin Children’s Museum, Bullock Texas State History Museum, and Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum.

This year is [MCN](http://mcn.edu/)’s 50th anniversary, so it’s a big event. I’m looking forward to [Bringing Our Values to Work](http://conference.mcn.edu/2017/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=518F99C4-CDC5-A724-3292-89737BC42B16&page_key=0244AE70-CFED-1DEC-42AB-9041A6F4885D&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0) with Monica Montgomery, [Stepping Back to Leap Forward](http://conference.mcn.edu/2017/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=519558AB-061C-969D-C032-05AA9ABDF84B&page_key=0244AE70-CFED-1DEC-42AB-9041A6F4885D&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0) with David McKenzie and Sara Pasch, and the MCN50 Reception at the Warhol Museum -- and the ignite reception is always fun

I’m excited to attend the evening events at AASLH, specifically the Keep History Weird reception at the Bullock Museum and Texas Beer, BBQ, and Boot-Scootin’. I bought a pair of cowboy boots in Texas when I was last in Houston, so I’m glad to finally have a legitimate excuse to wear them (at least for the beer and barbeque, not so much the dancing).


### Amelia is Looking Forward to...

[MuseumNext](https://www.museumnext.com/) was one of my first museum conferences a few years ago, and I met some of my best museum friends there, so I'm mostly looking forward to catching up and meeting new amazing folks. Because of my role in our hiring process and in finding new projects, equity and inclusion are always go-to themes for me, so I'm particularly interested in "Stories for Fighting with Fascist AIs" with [Aziz Isham](https://www.museumnext.com/speakers/aziz-isham/?event=202) and "Walking the Walk: Personal Activism in Professional Contexts" with [Kate Livingston](https://www.museumnext.com/speakers/kate-livingston/?event=202) and [Danielle Linzer](https://www.museumnext.com/speakers/danielle-linzer/?event=202). I'm also loving the people-centered focus of Seema Rao's "Trust the Revolution." And this will be my first time speaking at a museum conference!

On the other side of the spectrum, I've never been to MCN, so I'm excited for a brand new experience. I immediately signed up for [The Future of Cultural Heritage: Science Fiction, Design Thinking, and Museums](http://conference.mcn.edu/2017/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=5195FF2F-9B47-C55C-37E0-990EF3817547&page_key=&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0) with Desi Gonzalez and Jessica Warchall. I'm a sci fi reader and occasional sci fi writer, so I'm giddy about the possibility of connecting my museums-life with my non-museums-life.

[Museums Aren’t Neutral: Connecting Authentically in a New Political Era](http://conference.mcn.edu/2017/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=5193F8AF-B5AE-CE07-5B0F-04FEC790C4CE&page_key=&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0) with Mara Kurlandsky and Andrew Mandinach is timely and necessary, and it looks like there's a great balance of specific case studies with audience inquiry. Related, I am psyched for [Advocacy through Empathy: Using Digital Technology to Inspire Action](http://conference.mcn.edu/2017/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=518EACE0-D1D9-EB27-457B-4E264C98561E&page_key=&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0). Yes, I'm excited to see Mike talk and to share our work, but I'm also legitimately thrilled to learn from the other phenomenal institutions on this panel. This is the work we dream of doing and the impact we strive for with every project.
