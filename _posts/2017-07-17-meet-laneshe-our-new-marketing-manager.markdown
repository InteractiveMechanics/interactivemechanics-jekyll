### 1. What did you do before joining Interactive Mechanics?

Prior to joining the Interactive Mechanics team I was a part of the marketing department for the [Painted Bride Art Center](https://paintedbride.org), a non-profit arts venue presenting theater, jazz, dance, world music and visual arts as well as community programming. In addition to marketing I coordinated the Bride’s Souls of Black Folks program for the development of new work and the Monologue Mondays series for professional development of actors. I am also one of the co-founders and producers of [Theatre in the X](http://www.theatreinthex.com/), a theater company that produces free outdoor theater productions for the community. 

### 2. How did you get into marketing?

I began my first marketing pursuits as early as four years old. I was in dance classes and talked my family and friends into buying tickets and ads in our recital program book. My love for marketing has always grown alongside my involvement in the arts. The task of acquiring audiences is just as important as the task of performing to me. During my undergraduate time at Temple University I studied communications and theater and was both a performer and on staff in the marketing department for Temple’s Theater Department. 

### 3. What’s your go-to place to spark your creativity?

Anywhere outdoors and out of the ordinary. I find the best places to get the creative juices flowing are places outside my usual day-to-day path. Being near water is a bonus. The [John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/john_heinz/) right outside the city is one of the beautiful outdoor spaces that allow for me to step outside the usual and think creatively. 

### 4. What did you love about the last museum you visited?

The last museum I visited was [The Franklin Institute](https://www.fi.edu/). I went with a nine year old and a two year old and I loved that all three of us found things that we enjoyed and learned from. Their interactive exhibits offer hands on learning and fun. SportsZone and the Robot Revolution exhibits are two of my favorites. 

### 5. What’s your favorite spot in Philadelphia?

I really love [Spruce Street Harbor Park](http://www.delawareriverwaterfront.com/places/spruce-street-harbor-park). It’s beautiful, it’s by the water, and you can choose your level of entertainment from complete relaxation in a hammock to a game of bocce ball. It feels almost magical, especially in the evening when it’s all lit up. As a mom I love spaces that offer entertainment for all ages and Spruce Street Harbor Park fulfills that as well.
